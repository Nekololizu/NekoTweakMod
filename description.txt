Neko's Tweak Mod
Adds several vanilla quality of life and balance changes

Few example features:

- Placed buff items like bewitching table,ammo box etc now work similar to campfires giving you the buff while nearby & also for 10minutes after

- Adds corruption/crimson/event items all the time for NPCs

- Living Tree & Pyramid chest loot from fishing crates *still WIP*
(Finch staff & Sandstorm in a Bottle etc)

- Feral claws now give "melee autoswing" (Melee Autoswing also applies to summoner whips) 

- Merchant now sell the full mining set so its achievable early on

- A more linear fishing rod progression with buffs/nerfs to all rods, better early rods

- Shackle now gives a small amount of aggro when equipped & also have the tooltip "Enemies are more likely to target you"

- Ivy whip renamed to "Ivy hook" to prevent confusions with the summoner whip weapons
