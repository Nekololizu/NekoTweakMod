# **Current Features** 

- Sharpening Station,Ammo Box,Crystal Ball,slice of cake & Bewitching Table etc
(Now work like campfires giving the buff permanently while you are nearby one and for 10minutes if you go away from them, similar to honey buff if you leave the honey)

- Muramasa damage changed from 21 to 26
(Bit more competetive damage as it can't apply any debuffs, but also not to much due to its fast attack speed)

- A more linear fishing rod progression with buffs/nerfs to all rods, better early rods

- Steampunker will always sell the mechanic's fishing rod

- Adds corruption/crimson/hallow Items all the time for Dryad & Steampunker

- Spider Mask now only give minion damage & Dryad now sells pygmy necklace pre hardmode

- Living Tree & Pyramid chest loot from fishing crates *still WIP*
(Finch staff & Sandstorm in a Bottle etc)

- Feral claws changed from "12% increased melee speed" to "melee autoswing"
(Melee Autoswing also applies to summoner whips) 

- Titan glove changed from " 100% increased melee knockback & melee autoswing" to "100% increased melee knockback 12% increased melee speed"

- Fire gauntlet melee damage & speed increased from 10% to 12%

- Reaver Shark(Pickaxe) Use time changed from 22 to 19 (Slightly faster)

- Worm Scarf now has 2 defense along with the 17% damage reduction
(Due to BoC 2.0 being a thing)

- Some summoner weapon sound changes so they fit their weapons better

- Finch Staff knockback changed from 4 to 0, damage changed from 7 to 9
(Won't knock enemies into you anymore & bit more damage so it can be useful for more than killing slimes)
^this one is disabled until tmod updates to v1.4

- Shackle now gives 50 aggro & also have the tooltip "Enemies are more likely to target you"
(Weak aggro to have the option to "tank" pre hardmode)

- Ivy whip renamed to "Ivy hook" to prevent confusions with the summoner whip weapons

**Everything below here is WIP/Planned~ and might change**

**Fishing related:**

- Desert/Oasias crates can give Pyramid loot
(Oasis & Mirage crates)

- Iron,Mythril,Golden & Titanium crates can give Living Tree chest loot
(Makes it possible to obtain Finch Staff from fishing anywhere for early game summoners if its not in a chest)

- Fledgling Wings obtainable from Titanium crates in hardmode
(So its not Journey mode exclusive, and still not obtainable before other wings to break balance)

- Sky/Floating island crates can give "Band of starpower & Crimson rod"
(Sky & Azure crates)

- Increased chance for Water Walking Boots(1 in 11 to 1 in 5) & Lava Charm(1 in 40 to 39 in 200) from Ocean & Lava crates respectively
(To reduce the grind/rng for Terraspark Boots)

- Obsidian & Hellstone crates from lava can give "Hotline Fishing Hook" at a 1 in 40 chance

- Obsidian & Hellstone crates chance for Lavaproof fishing hook changed from 39 in 200 to 1 in 40 

- Corrupt,Defiled,Crimson & Hematic crates crates now have a chance to give Bloody tear & Chum Caster
(Makes it possible to get bloody tears when no blood moons are happening from evil biome fishing)



**Weapon/Armor/Accessorie related:**

- Ninja set becoming a summoner armor

- Obsidian Outlaw Hat now gives "Increases minion damage by 5%" instead of having no bonus

- Obsidian armor now has a set effect giving "Increases your max number of minions by 1" instead of having no set effect
(To have a summoner armor obtainable pre boss, while still not making it obtainable instantly from wood armor etc and to not compete directly with bee armor later)

- Flesh Knuckles,Berserker's Glove & Hero Shield defense changed from 7 to 10
(Evens it out a bit compared to Putrid scent "worth" wise)


**NPC related:**

- Dryad now sell opposite evil biome powder in graveyard biomes

- Steampunker now sells the opposite evil biome solution in graveyard biomes

- Jungle Mimic can spawn in post plantera Underground Jungle, drops temple traps

(Recall & Return potions still have a faster "use time" to keep them useful)
(On/off toggle in game QoL)

- Obsidian block mining power requirement changed from 65% to 55% 
(bone/gold/plat or better, so its possible to break pre bosses without requiring bombs)

- Trapped Chests now work like Dead Man's Chests and can be used for storage

- corruption/crimson version of mud/jungle blocks
(Keeping the jungle biome active even if it gets infected by an evil biome)
