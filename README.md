# **Current Features** 

- Sharpening Station,Ammo Box,Crystal Ball,slice of cake & Bewitching Table etc
(Now work like campfires giving the buff permanently while you are nearby one and for 10minutes if you go away from them, similar to honey buff if you leave the honey)

- Muramasa damage changed from 21 to 26
(Bit more competetive damage as it can't apply any debuffs, but also not to much due to its fast attack speed)

- A more linear fishing rod progression with buffs/nerfs to all rods, better early rods

- Steampunker will always sell the mechanic's fishing rod

- Adds corruption/crimson/hallow Items all the time for Dryad & Steampunker

- Spider Mask now only give minion damage & Dryad now sells pygmy necklace pre hardmode

- Living Tree & Pyramid chest loot from fishing crates *still WIP*
(Finch staff & Sandstorm in a Bottle etc)

- The ninja armor now gives 20% summon damage instead of movement speed as its set bonus

- The obsidian armor now have a set effect giving 30% summon damage
Additionally the helm,shirt,pants give 5,10 & 5 % summon damage respectively

- Feral claws changed from "12% increased melee speed" to "melee autoswing"
(Melee Autoswing also applies to summoner whips) 

- Titan glove changed from " 100% increased melee knockback & melee autoswing" to "100% increased melee knockback 12% increased melee speed"

- Fire gauntlet melee damage & speed increased from 10% to 12%

- Reaver Shark(Pickaxe) Use time changed from 22 to 19 (Slightly faster)

- Worm Scarf now has 2 defense along with the 17% damage reduction
(Due to BoC 2.0 being a thing)

- Some summoner weapon sound changes so they fit their weapons better

- Finch Staff knockback changed from 4 to 0, damage changed from 7 to 9
(Won't knock enemies into you anymore & bit more damage so it can be useful for more than killing slimes)
^this one is disabled until tmod updates to v1.4

- Shackle now gives 50 aggro & also have the tooltip "Enemies are more likely to target you"
(Weak aggro to have the option to "tank" pre hardmode)

- Ivy whip renamed to "Ivy hook" to prevent confusions with the summoner whip weapons

- Merchant now sell the full mining set so its achievable early on




# **Everything below here is WIP/Planned~ and might change**

**Fishing related:**

- Fledgling Wings obtainable from Titanium crates in hardmode
(So its not Journey mode exclusive, and still not obtainable before other wings to break balance)

- Increased chance for Water Walking Boots & Lava Charm from Ocean & Lava crates respectively
(To reduce the grind/rng for Terraspark Boots)

- Obsidian & Hellstone crates from lava can give "Hotline Fishing Hook" 

- Corrupt,Defiled,Crimson & Hematic crates now have a chance to give Bloody tear & Chum Caster
(Makes it possible to get bloody tears when no blood moons are happening from evil biome fishing)




**Weapon/Armor/Accessorie related:**

- Ninja & Obsidian Outlaw set becoming a summoner armor

- Flesh Knuckles,Berserker's Glove & Hero Shield defense changed from 7 to 10

(Evens it out a bit compared to Putrid scent "worth" wise)


**NPC related:**

- Jungle Mimic can spawn in post plantera Underground Jungle, drops temple traps

(can be spawned manually by placing temple key inside an empty chest, Has a jungle mimic banner)



**Item/crafting related:**

- Cell phone now makes a portal like "potion of return" when you go back home

(Recall & Return potions still have a faster "use time" to keep them useful)
(On/off toggle in game QoL)

- Obsidian block mining power requirement changed from 65% to 55%

(bone/gold/plat or better, so its possible to break pre bosses without requiring bombs)



**Custom items:**


- Bottomless honey bucket

- Honey sponge

- corruption/crimson version of mud/jungle blocks
(Keeping the jungle biome active even if it gets infected by an evil biome)

- Make [Ambient objects](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Ambient_objects) lootable/placeable as furniture
